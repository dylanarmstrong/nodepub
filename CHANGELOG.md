## v2.0.7

- Thanks to [Harold Treen](https://github.com/haroldtreen) the API has switched to being asynchronous

## v1.0.7

- This version introduces stability at the expense of minor breaking changes, consisting almost entirely of renames from chapter to section but with some of the pre-generated pages of earlier versions eliminated. The result is more abstracted but also more flexible, whilst also retaining most of it's simplicity.
